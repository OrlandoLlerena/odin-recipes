<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Pernil is roasted pork shoulder, seasoned to the max. It is served with rice
  and beans, salad, or sweet plantains.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>10 cloves garlic, or more to taste</li>
  <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
  <li>5 pounds pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Combine garlic cloves, olive oil, vinegar, oregano, salt, and black pepper
    in a mortar and pestle; mash into a paste.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cut deep slits into pork with a small knife. Stuff slits with garlic paste;
    rub any remaining paste over pork.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place pork in a plastic roasting bag and put in a roasting pan with a rack.
    Let marinate in the refrigerator, 8 to 48 hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take pork out of the refrigerator, uncover, and bring to room temperature, 1
    to 2 hours.
  </li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
  <li>
    Roast pork skin-side down in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 2
    hours. Flip pork and continue roasting, skin-side up, until juices run clear
    and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145
    degrees F (63 degrees C), 2 to 4 hours more.
  </li>
</ol>
