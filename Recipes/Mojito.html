<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving,
  but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very
  refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If
  you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and
  you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!
</p>

<p>
  This Cuban cocktail is a blend of a few simple ingredients, but the resulting
  drink is the perfect balance of sweet and tart, not to mention refreshing!
  What makes this a five-star recipe? It stays true to the original mojito with
  real, fresh ingredients. The recipe makes one serving, but you can easily
  scale it up to make a pitcher for summertime entertaining.
