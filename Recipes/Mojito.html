<h2>What is Mojito?</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not
  surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including
  rum, lime, mint, and sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda
  to create a thirst-quenching libation. It requires a bit more labor than many
  mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar
  together to release the flavors. But it's well worth it for a refreshing,
  fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to
  this day.
</p>
<p>
  This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving,
  but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very
  refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If
  you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and
  you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 1/2 fluid ounces white rum</li>
  <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
  <li>1/2 medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
  <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
  <li>1/2 cup club soda, or as needed</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You'll Need to Make a Mojito</h3>
<p>
  As with most cocktails, crafting mojitos requires a few special tools â€”
  namely, a muddler. This bartending tool is used to crush fresh herbs and
  fruits to help release their flavors. If you don't have a muddler, use the end
  of a wooden spoon instead.
