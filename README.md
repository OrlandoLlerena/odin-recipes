Odin Project

Welcome to the Recipe coding project! This project is designed to create a digital recipe site where users can browse recipes.

## Project Overview

The Recipe project is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform the following actions:

1. **Browse Recipes:** Users can view a list of available recipes, along with their names, images, and brief descriptions.

2. **Search for Recipes:** Users can search for recipes by name, ingredients, or tags. The search results should be displayed dynamically as the user types.

3. **View Recipe Details:** Users can click on a recipe to view its detailed information, including ingredients, instructions, and a larger image.

4. **Responsive Design:** The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odin-receipes.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:** Make sure you have a text editor and a web browser installed. You may also want to use a code editor like Visual Studio Code for development.

3. **Open the Project:** Open the project folder in your code editor.

4. **Explore the Starter Code:** The starter code includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Take some time to understand the structure and organization of the code.

5. **Start Coding:** Begin by implementing the basic functionality, such as displaying recipes, searching, and viewing recipe details. Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

6. **Testing:** Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Consider using testing frameworks or tools if you're familiar with them.

7. **Documentation:** Document your code and include comments to explain complex logic or functionality.

8. **Styling:** Make sure your application is visually appealing and user-friendly by styling it with CSS.

9. **Deployment:** Once your project is complete, you can deploy it to a web hosting platform of your choice. You might consider using GitHub Pages or Netlify for free hosting.
